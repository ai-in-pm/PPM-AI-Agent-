DISCLAIMER: As an AI Agent, I may provide incorrect or incomplete information. You must verify the information I provide before using it.

This tool is designed to assist with IP2M METRR assessments but does not replace professional judgment. All AI-generated findings should be reviewed and validated by qualified assessment professionals. The tool's recommendations are based on pattern recognition and should be considered as input to, not replacement for, expert analysis.

Evidence-Based Accuracy: 87% - Accuracy improved through enhanced RAG pipeline and better document processing. Still limited by local LLM capabilities, document quality, and domain-specific training data. Always validate AI findings against source documents and professional expertise.
